FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
============================

Performs the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) function on a random data set.

Note: This application was taken from the SHOC suite
      (http://ft.ornl.gov/doku/shoc/).

Implementations:
  * c: C implementation
  * js: JavaScript implementation
  * matlab: Matlab implementation using native support for complex numbers with the same algorithm as for the c and js implementations
  * matlab-native: Matlab implementation that uses the builtin fft2 function, which is much faster and provides a good reference for high-performance library implementations
